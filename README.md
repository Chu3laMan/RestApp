# RestApp
it's a direct practice for Restful to give my application a third party application, I've tried to use SoapUI to test these service methods. 
the following list of tested URLs coresponding with the HTTP methods

URI: http://localhost:8080/basic/rest/users
➤  HTTP Method: GET
➤  Activity: Returns the list of all users

URI: http://localhost:8080/basic/rest/users
➤ HTTP Method: POST
➤ Activity: Adds a new user

URI: http://localhost:8080/basic/rest/users/3
➤ HTTP Method: PUT
➤ Updates the user specified with its id

URI: http://localhost:8080/basic/rest/users/3
➤ HTTP Method: DELETE
➤ Activity: Deletes the user specified with its id
